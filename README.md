📷 Python Image Compression using SOM Neural Network

📄 Description

This project implements an image compression algorithm using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network. The SOM algorithm helps in reducing the size of an image by clustering similar pixels together, which is particularly useful for image storage and transmission.

🚀 Installation Instructions

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python-Image-Compression-using-SOM-Neural-network.git
cd Python-Image-Compression-using-SOM-Neural-network
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
📸 Usage

To compress an image using the SOM neural network, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python compress_image.py --input <path_to_input_image> --output <path_to_output_image> --dimensions <width>x<height>
Example:

bash
Copy code
python compress_image.py --input images/sample.jpg --output images/compressed_sample.jpg --dimensions 100x100
This will compress the input image and save the compressed image to the specified output path.

✨ Features

Image Compression: Reduce image size by clustering similar pixels.
