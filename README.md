Python Image Compression using SOM Neural Network

Description

This project implements an image compression algorithm using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network. The SOM algorithm helps in reducing the size of an image by clustering similar pixels together, which can be particularly useful for image storage and transmission.

Installation Instructions

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python-Image-Compression-using-SOM-Neural-network.git
cd Python-Image-Compression-using-SOM-Neural-network
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

To compress an image using the SOM neural network, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python compress_image.py --input <path_to_input_image> --output <path_to_output_image> --dimensions <width>x<height>
Example:

bash
Copy code
python compress_image.py --input images/sample.jpg --output images/compressed_sample.jpg --dimensions 100x100
This will compress the input image and save the compressed image to the specified output path.

Features

Image Compression: Reduce image size by clustering similar pixels.
Custom Dimensions: Specify the desired dimensions for the compressed image.
Easy Integration: Simple command-line interface for compressing images.
